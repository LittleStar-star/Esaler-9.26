                                A semiconductor is a material whose conductivity can be controlled
                                from insulator to conductor. Whether from the perspective of science
                                and technology or economic development, the importance of
                                semiconductors is very great. Today, the core units of most electronic
                                products, such as computers, mobile phones or digital recorders, are
                                closely related to semiconductors. Common semiconductor materials
                                include silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, etc., and silicon is one
                                of the most influential semiconductor materials in commercial
                                applications.

                                The classification of semiconductors can be divided into: integrated
                                circuit devices, discrete devices, photoelectric semiconductors, logic
                                IC, analog IC, memory and other categories according to their
                                manufacturing technology. Generally speaking, these will be divided
                                into small categories. In addition, it is classified by application field.
                                design method, etc. In addition, there are also methods that can be
                                divided into analog, digital, analog-to-digital mixing and function
                                classification according to the processed signals.

                                The earliest practical "semiconductor" was "transistor / diode".
                                1、 In radio and television, it is used as "signal amplifier / rectifier".
                                2、 Recently, the development of "solar power" is also used in "solar
                                cell".
                                3、 Semiconductors can be used to measure temperature. The
                                temperature measurement range can reach 70% of the application
                                fields such as production, life, medical and health, scientific research
                                and teaching, and has high accuracy and stability.
